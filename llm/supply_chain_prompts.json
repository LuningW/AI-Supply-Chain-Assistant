                "Reference Answer": "The dual-warehouse system is strategically superior to a single warehouse due to its cost-efficiency, operational resilience, and service flexibility. Warehouse W2's significantly lower transportation costs to key markets (e.g., just 1 unit to C2) enable optimal distribution that reduces total costs by 18-25%, while maintaining redundancy that prevents single-point failures and accommodates C4's exclusive W1 supply requirement. The model's 80% service-level flexibility for one market, combined with W2's efficient handling of high-demand markets like C2, minimizes service disruptions. Mathematical validation confirms that a single-warehouse approach would substantially increase costs and risk unmet demand, making the dual-warehouse structure the optimal solution for balancing cost, reliability, and adaptability."

While W2→C2 has a lower cost (1) than W1→C2 (4), W2's capacity is prioritized for C3 (which has no alternative supply) and a portion of C2. The remaining C2 demand is supplied from W1 because: 1) W1 has available capacity after supplying C1 and C4, and 2) Using W1 for the balance avoids more costly alternatives like increasing P2→W1 shipments (cost 4) or using P1→W2 (cost 5)."

                "User Question": "What explains why all products destined for c4 come from w1?",

This decision is based on the strict constraint that C4 can only be served from W1. Regardless of cost considerations, the system must allocate C4's entire demand (20,000 units) to W1. This constraint takes priority over cost optimization for this particular market, though fortunately W1 has sufficient capacity to accommodate this requirement without compromising the overall optimal solution."
